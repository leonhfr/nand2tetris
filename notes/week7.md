# Week 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic

- in some modern languages (i.e. Java), the high level code is not translated directly to machine language
- Java compilers translate the high level code into code written in an intermediate language, designed to operate on some abstract processing layer known as a virtual machine

Key concepts:
- two tier compilation
- virtualization
- virtual machines
- VM abstraction
- stack processing
- pointers
- VM implementation
- VM translators

## The Road Ahead

- hello world program
- issues:
  - program execution? we take it for granted
  - writing on the screen?
  - keywords? class, function,...
  - how does the computer know how to execute loops?
  - function call and return
  - operating system
- most programmers think of the program they write and the programming language as an abstraction

What makes the abstraction work?
- assembler
- virtual machine
- compiler
- operating system
