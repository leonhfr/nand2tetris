## The Road Ahead

Secret of computer science: we don't worry about the "how", it's enough to worry to worry about the "what".

How = implementation

What = abstraction

The point of programming languages: the abstraction is what it promises to do, we don't have to worry about the implementation. Trust that someone else worries about the how.

Computer science: we can separate concerns.

Several simple stages build on top of each other.

Goals:
- build a complete functioning computer that can run anything including games like tetris (using only modest nand gates)
- experience implementing abstraction
